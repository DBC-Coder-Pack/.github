# DBC Toolkit

Welcome to the **DBC Toolkit**!

This is the place for developers working on creating a modding API for the DBC mod. Our goal is to keep the modding community alive and make it easier for everyone to create and share their own custom addons.

### What’s this about?

The **DBC Toolkit** is a collaborative project to help people modify and improve the Dragon Block C mod. Since DBC isn’t actively maintained anymore, we want to build a simple, open framework that lets anyone add custom features and share addons. By creating a modding API, we also aim to reduce the incompatibilities between different addons and make sure they can all play nicely together.

### Our Goal

- **Standardized API**: Provide an easy-to-use API for modding DBC, so adding custom features is simple and consistent.
- **Reduce Incompatibilities**: The API helps prevent conflicts between addons, making sure they work smoothly together.
- **Community Collaboration**: Create a space where modders can collaborate, share ideas, and help each other out.
- **Enhance Modding**: Make it easier for anyone to add new mechanics, items, or features to DBC.
- **Keep DBC Alive**: Help keep DBC fun and fresh for the long haul!
